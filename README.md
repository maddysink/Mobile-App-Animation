# Mobile-App-Animation

# Summary
This is a prototype of a fitness app home screen that has animated interaction elements for my Innovative Technologies for Design Class

# About
Using Figma, I created several animated elements that provide engagement and feedback for users.  I chose to do this project in Figma because I think it is most beneficial for my path as a UX designer, and I am really glad I did because I learned lots of new Figma skills that I can apply to other interfaces.  I created three different animations on this home page.  The first animation greets the user as they enter the app, as the progress bars raise from empty to filled levels of progression.  The next animation I created also occurs when the user opens the app, but also when the user taps on it.  When the user does one of those two actions, the total Kilocalorie counter animates from zero to the Kilocalorie amount by counting up. These animations are fun and add energy to the interface. Finally, the last animation I created is in the "My Plan" section.  Users can tap on the lightning bolt icon and it will change from unfilled to filled, with a bounce animation.  This animation provides fun feedback to the user and increases visual interest.

# Reflection
Surprisingly, I really enjoyed this project.  I have limited experience with animation and usually stay away from it at all costs, but the aspect of including small animations in a digital experinece to increase interactability, visual interest, and fun really excites me.  I learned several new things in Figma regarding interaction design that I will continue to use in experiences I create going forward.  Learning these new Figma interaction design skills will definitely make me a more attractive candidate as I begin to look for a career in UX design.  I am really happy that I learned some new Figma skills beyond the standard interaction tools, this has inspired me to continue to develop my Figma animation skills.
